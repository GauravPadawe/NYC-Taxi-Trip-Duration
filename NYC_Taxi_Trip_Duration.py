# # NYC Taxi Trip Duration
# 
# ### DOMAIN: Transportation

# **By Gaurav Padawe** - 26th April, 2019

# The dataset is based on the **2016 NYC Yellow Cab trip record** data made available in **Big Query** on **Google Cloud Platform**. The data was originally published by the **NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC)**. The data was sampled and cleaned for the purposes of this playground. Based on individual trip attributes, should predict the duration of each trip.

# 
# 
# # Objective:
# 
# **Build a model that predicts the total trip duration of taxi trips in New York City.**
# 

# # Evaluation Metric
# 
# - The evaluation metric for this competition is Root Mean Squared Logarithmic Error.
# 
# 
# - The RMSLE is calculated as
# 
# ![alt text](https://i.stack.imgur.com/952Ox.png)
# 
# Where:
# 
#     - ϵ is the RMSLE value (score)
#     - n is the total number of observations in the (public/private) data set,
#     - pi is your prediction of trip duration, and
#     - ai is the actual trip duration for i. 
#     - log(x) is the natural logarithm of x

# # Questions Arising:
# 
# 
#     - What types of Variables do we have ?
#     - Are there any False trips or Invalid data point which exceeds Trip Duration well above impossibility ?
#     - What’s the most frequent travelled destination ?
# 
# 
# And much more to know as we continue with our Analysis. 

# # Architecture

df = pd.read_csv("train.csv", header=0, parse_dates=True)
df.head()


# # Findings
# 
# - DateTime columns for Pickup and Dropoff which needs **Feature extraction** as there might be lots of hidden info.
# 
# 
# - We also have **Geo-Spatial data** which we can plot using Visualization tools like **Tableau, PowerBI, QlikView, etc**

#vendor_id - a code indicating the provider associated with the trip record
sns.set_context('talk')

plt.figure(figsize=(8,8))
sns.countplot(df['vendor_id'], palette='Dark2')
plt.title("Vendor ID")


# - From Above Visualization, we can say that there are **2 vendors** (Service Providers).
# 
# 
# - 2nd Service provider is the most opted one by New Yorkers.

# In[ ]:


plt.figure(figsize=(8,8))
plt.pie(df['store_and_fwd_flag'].value_counts(), colors=['lightgreen', 'lightcoral'], shadow=True, explode=[0.5,0], autopct='%1.2f%%', startangle=200)
plt.legend(labels=['Y','N'])
plt.title("Store and Forward Flag")


# - store_and_fwd_flag - This flag indicates whether the trip record was held in vehicle memory before sending to the vendor because the vehicle did not have a connection to the server - Y = store and forward; N = not a store and forward trip.
# 
# 
# - Visualization tells us that there were very few trips of which the records were stored in memory due to no connection to the server.

# # Label Encoding Features having Categorical Values

# In[ ]:


from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder

enc = LabelEncoder()
df['store_and_fwd_flag'] = enc.fit_transform(df['store_and_fwd_flag'])
df['vendor_id'] = enc.fit_transform(df['vendor_id'])

#df['vendor_id'] = df['vendor_id'].astype('category')
#df['store_and_fwd_flag'] = df['store_and_fwd_flag'].astype('category')


# - Conversion of 'store_and_fwd_flag' and 'vendor_id' to be Label encoded as those are Categorical features , binarizing them will help us to compute them with ease.
# 
# 
# - We can convert these features into “category” type by function called “astype(‘category’)” that will speed up the Computation. Since, my plan is to go with PCA for dimension reduction, I’m not going with that approach.

# # Descriptive Statistics

# In[ ]:


plt.figure(figsize=(25,10))
sns.heatmap(df.describe()[1:], annot=True, cmap='gist_earth')
plt.title('Descriptive Stats')


# - We can observe that there were trips having 0 passengers which we can consider as false trip.
# 
# 
# - Also, there are trips having trip duration upto 3526282 seconds (Approx. 980 hours) which is kind of impossible in a day.

# In[ ]:


#Visualising Trip duration we can clearly notice few outliers at extreme right
plt.figure(figsize=(20,5))
sns.boxplot(df['trip_duration'])


# - Probably in this visualization we can clearly see some outliers , their trips are lasting between 1900000 seconds (528 Hours) to somewhere around 3500000 (972 hours) seconds which is impossible in case of taxi trips , How can a taxi trip be that long ?
# 
# 
# - It’s Quite suspicious. We’ll have to get rid of those Outliers.

# In[ ]:


plt.figure(figsize=(20,5))
sns.boxplot(df['passenger_count'], color='maroon')
plt.title('Passenger Count Distribution')


# - Most number of trips are done by 1-2 passenger(s).
# 
# 
# - But one thing is Interesting to observe, there exist trip with Zero passengers, was that a free ride ? Or just a False data recorded ?
# 
# 
# - Above 4 Passengers Indicate that the cab must be larger sized.

# In[ ]:


#Log Transformation
plt.figure(figsize=(10,8))
sns.distplot(np.log(df['trip_duration']), kde=False, color='black')
plt.title("Log Transformed - Trip Duration")


# - Since our Evaluation Metric is RMSLE, we'll proceed further with Log Transformed "Trip duration".
# 
# 
# - Log Transformation Smoothens outliers by proving them less weightage.

# # Geo Spatial Data

# - Now, we also have Geographical data (Latitude and Longitude) for pickup points and dropoff points.
# 
# 
# - You can refer to my Tableau Interactive Visualizations for geographical data analysis here: https://public.tableau.com/profile/gaurav.padawe#!/vizhome/NYCTaxiTripAnalysis2016/NYCTaxi-DropoffPoint
# 
# 
# - I had created Interactive dashboard where you can choose filter from "vendor_id", "month" and "hour".
# 
# 
# - There are total 2 plots , a 'pickup' and a 'dropoff' point plot.
# 
# 
# 1) **vendor_id** filter will let you choose the specific service provider and analyse its insights.
# 
# 
# 2) **month** filter will let you choose specific month to get insights on monthly basis.
# 
# 
# 3) **hour** filter permits you to observe patterns / trends in trips on hourly basis.

new_df.head()


# Normalizing the Dataset using Standard Scaling Technique.
# 
# 
# Now, Why Standard Scaling ? Why not MinMax or Normalizer ?
# 
# 
# - It is because MinMax adjusts the value between 0’s and 1’s , which tend to work better for optimization techniques like Gradient descent and machine learning algorithms like KNN.
# 
# 
# - While, Normalizer uses distance measurement like Euclidean or Manhattan, so Normalizer tend to work better with KNN.

# # The First Approach - Decomposition using Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

# - Now that we’re done, we have to pass our Scaled Dataframe in PCA model and observe the elbow plot to get better idea of explained variance.
# 
# 
# - Why PCA ? It's a Dimensionality Reduction Technique. It is also a Feature extraction Technique. By PCA we create new features from old (Original) Features but the new features will always be independent of each other. So, its not just Dimensionality Reduction Process, we are even eliminating Correlation between the Variables.
# 
# 
# - We'll also go through a approach without using PCA in Second Part and Later compare results with PCA approach.

# - Above plot gives us detailed idealogy of which feature has contributed more or less to our each Principal Component.
# 
# 
# - Pricipal Components are our new features which consists of Information from every other original Feature we have. 
# 
# 
# - We reduce the Dimensions using PCA by retaining as much as Information possible. 

# # Splitting Data and Algorithms

# - Let’s pass the PCA Transformed data in our Machine Learning Regression Algorithms. To begin with , Linear Regression is a good approach, by splitting our Data into Training and Testing (30%).
# 
# # Why Linear Regression , Decision Tree and Random Forest ?
# 
# ### Linear regression:
# 
# - Simple to explain.
# 
# 
# - Model training and prediction are fast.
# 
# 
# - No tuning is required except regularization.
# 
# ### Decision Tree:
# 
# - Decision trees are very intuitive and easy to explain.
# 
# 
# - They follow the same pattern of thinking that humans use when making decisions.
# 
# 
# - Decision trees are a common-sense technique to find the best solutions to problems with uncertainty.
# 
# ### Random Forest:
# 
# - It is one of the most accurate learning algorithms available.
# 
# 
# - Random Forest consisits of multiple Decision Tress - Results from multiple trees are then merged to give best possible final outcome.
# 
# 
# - Random forests overcome several problems with decision trees like Reduction in overfitting.
# 
# 
# **So, I want to approach from base model built using basic Linear Regression and then bring in more Sophisticated Algorithms - Decision Tree & Random Forest. It will give us good idea how Linear Regression performs against Decision Tree Regressor and Random Forest Regressor. Later, we will also approach with same algorithms on "without PCA" data. Finally, we'll evaluate both approaches we took and lay down recommended approach and algorithms.**

# - From the above Viz. we can clearly identify that the Random Forest Algorithm is also performing good. The Actual Data (in Grey) and Predicted values (in Green) are as close as possible. We can conclude that Random Forest could be a good choice for Trip duration prediction.
# 
# 
# - Similarly, we can Hyper tune Random Forest to get the most out of it.

# # R2 Scores Evaluation

# - R2 Score or R-Squared is the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variable(s).
# 
# 
# - Best possible score is 1.0 and it can be negative (because the model can be arbitrarily worse). A constant model that always predicts the expected value of y, disregarding the input features, would get a R^2 score of 0.0.

# - Although , our Evaluation Metric isn't R2 Score but I'm just plotting them to check the Good Fit.
# 
# 
# - We're getting good fit score for Decision Tree and Random Forest , i.e, close to 1.0 

# # RMSLE Evaluation

# -  RMSLE is a measure of how spread out these residuals are. In other words, it tells you how concentrated the data is around the line of best fit.
# 
# 
# - With RMSLE we explicitly know how much our predictions deviate.
# 
# 
# - Lower values of RMSLE indicate better fit with lesser LOSS.

# - Remember our NULL RMSLE : 0.1146 as a benchmark to beat.
# 
# 
# - We can observe from above Viz. that our Decision Tree model and Random Forest model are good performers. As, Random Forest is providing us reduced RMSLE, we can say that it's a model to Opt for.

# # The Second Approach - Without PCA

# - Another approach we could go with is without PCA, just Standard Scaling Dataset and applying our Algorithms.
# 
# 
# - The approach can give us better idea of what works better for us.
# 
# 
# - This approach might take great amount of computational resources and time, it will be good if we can run this on Google’s Collaboratory, that will eliminate huge computational stress on our system as the program will be running on Cloud.

# # What's better - Decision Tree or Random Forest ?

# - One problem that might occur with Decision Tree is that it can overfit.
# 
# 
# - Difference is - A random forest is a collection of decision trees.
# 
# 
# - A decision tree model considers all the features which makes it memorize everything, it gets overfitted on training data which couldn't predict well on unseen data.
# 
# 
# - A random forest chooses few number of rows at random and interprets results from all the Tress and combines it to get more accurate and stable final result.

# # Insights:
# 
# - Observed which taxi service provider is most Frequently used by New Yorkers.
# 
# 
# - Found out few trips which were of duration 528 Hours to 972 Hours, possibly Outliers.
# 
# 
# - With the help of Tableau, we’re able to make good use of Geographical Data provided in the Dataset to figure prominent Locations of Taxi’s pickup / dropoff points.
# 
# 
# - Also, found out some Trips of which pickup / dropoff point ended up somewhere in North Atlantic Sea. 
# 
# 
# - Passenger count Analysis showed us that there were few trips with Zero Passengers.
# 
# 
# - Monthly trip analysis gives us a insight of Month – March and April marking the highest number of Trips while January marking lowest, possibly due to Snowfall.

# # Recommended Approach:
# 
# - Apply Standard Scaling on the Dataset to Normalize the values.
# 
# 
# - Further, Apply PCA to reduce dimensions, as you’ll extract features from our primary DateTime Feature. Those additional features might lead our model to suffer from **“Curse of dimensionality”** and could drastically affect performance.
# 
# 
# - Pass the PCA Transformed data in our ML Regression Algorithms and Evaluate results.

# # What's Next ?
# 
# - Further, one can improve the model's performance using **Hyper-Parameter Tuning.**
# 
# 
# - Other ML Algorithms can be Tried. 
# 
# 
# - One can take **ANN** approach.
